# Hospital-Spring-REST
Simple hospital system made with SpringBoot as a RESTful API
This project was made as a demonstration project for the needs of student internship at SerengetiTech.

This project simulates simple hospital. Patient can schedule an appointment, after appointment is done doctor writes an examination report, prescribes a therapy if needed (and needed medications).

Database(PostgreSQL) was auto-generated through Hibernate and entities and it's hosted on Docker container.

Project was made after learning about some new technologies and good practices that are used in software development to showcase everything that i learned while attending said internship.
